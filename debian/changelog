  [ CAD Debian Packager ]
  * New upstream release (2725260)

  [ Ola Bini ]
  * Use CAD docker repo instead of an individuals from the team
  * Use new version of packager image, and don't install dependencies that might not be needed
  * Testing something
  * And more
  * No entrypoint
  * Remove messing with entrypoint and use new image
  * Gitlab is getting annoying
  * Use an image that explicitly overlinks /bin/sh to avoid Gitlab detection script problems
  * Use next version of image
  * Since we've changed the main branch name, we should encode that here
  * Update docker file, and don't do apt update
  * Ignore dependencies. Maybe it will work anyway
  * Desperation
  * Try and see what happens with a build image based on backports
  * Update dependencies
  * And we need to tell Apt that we are running non-interactively
  * Remove verbose
  * Better to only run on main
